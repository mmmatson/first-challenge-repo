# <refactor-code>

## Description

This repository is where I refactored code to improve the accessibility of a site. I replaced non-semantic HTML elements with semantic HTML elements, updated headings to better reflect importance/rank, and added alternative text for images.

Other improvements:
- I updated links that were previously functioning incorrectly.
- I increased the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, then organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
- I included a couple of comments to organize code under the header and main areas of the page.
